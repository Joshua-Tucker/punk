From looking at the breif I notice alot of similarties in design with the ticket tracker as well as using the search bar and the dropdown menu to further filter results, so will lean heavily on this to extract a skeleton to use and make the neccasary adjustments.

first i will import the data i am going to use, and them make all the component folders so i know what im working with.

from there i will start at the bottom and work my way up, make the card, how im going to populate it , show all of them on the app.

after that i will add in the search and then the drop down options

then finally style it properlytop it looks good.

extension- add button to add more detail to the card when clicked on
